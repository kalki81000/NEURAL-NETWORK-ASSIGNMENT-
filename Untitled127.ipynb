        "Image segmentation is a **computer vision technique** that involves dividing an image into meaningful regions or segments to simplify its representation and make analysis easier. In simple terms, segmentation groups together pixels that share similar characteristics (such as color, texture, or intensity) so that objects or regions of interest can be clearly identified and separated from the background.\n",
        "### Types of Image Segmentation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Semantic Segmentation** ‚Äì Classifies every pixel into a category (e.g., all \"car\" pixels are labeled the same).\n",
        "2. **Instance Segmentation** ‚Äì Distinguishes between different objects of the same category (e.g., two separate cars).\n",
        "3. **Panoptic Segmentation** ‚Äì A combination of semantic and instance segmentation (labels every pixel and distinguishes instances).\n",
        "### Why is Image Segmentation Important?\n",

        "1. **Object Detection & Recognition**\n",

        "   * Helps doctors detect tumors, blood vessels, or organs in CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays by clearly separating regions of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Image Editing & Processing**\n",

        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "In **Mask R-CNN**, after the **Region Proposal Network (RPN)** suggests candidate regions (Regions of Interest, or RoIs), we need to extract fixed-size feature maps from these regions to feed into subsequent networks (for classification, bounding box regression, and mask prediction).\n",
        "\n",
        "In older models like **Faster R-CNN**, this was done using **RoIPool (Region of Interest Pooling)**. However, RoIPool introduced **misalignments** between the RoI and the extracted features because of **quantization (rounding)** of coordinates.\n",
        "### The Role of **RoIAlign**\n",
